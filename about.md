The spiritual successor of Freek's list of [100 theorems](https://www.cs.ru.nl/~freek/100/).
Now with more than 1000 theorems!

The entries of this list are extracted from Wikipedia's [List of Theorems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_theorems).
We do not accept entries that are not part of that list.

This project was initiated at the Special Trimester on "Prospects of Formalized Mathematics" at the Hausdorff Institute of Mathematics in Bonn, funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Foundation) under Germany ́s Excellence Strategy – EXC-2047/1 – 390685813.
